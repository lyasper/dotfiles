;; ===== Function to delete a line =====

;; First define a variable which will store the previous column position
(defvar previous-column nil "Save the column position")

;; Define the nuke-line function. The line is killed, then the newline
;; character is deleted. The column which the cursor was positioned at is then
;; restored. Because the kill-line function is used, the contents deleted can
;; be later restored by usibackward-delete-char-untabifyng the yank commands.
(defun nuke-line()
  "Kill an entire line, including the trailing newline character"
  (interactive)

  ;; Store the current column position, so it can later be restored for a more
  ;; natural feel to the deletion
  (setq previous-column (current-column))

  ;; Now move to the end of the current line
  (end-of-line)

  ;; Test the length of the line. If it is 0, there is no need for a
  ;; kill-line. All that happens in this case is that the new-line character
  ;; is deleted.
  (if (= (current-column) 0)
    (delete-char 1)

    ;; This is the 'else' clause. The current line being deleted is not zero
    ;; in length. First remove the line by moving to its start and then
    ;; killing, followed by deletion of the newline character, and then
    ;; finally restoration of the column position.
